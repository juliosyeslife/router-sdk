# zk-Rollup Journal

zk-Rollups are the most promising Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum — combining off-chain computation with on-chain cryptographic verification.  
They compress thousands of transactions into a single proof, preserving security while drastically reducing gas usage.

But zk-Rollups are more than a technical upgrade.  
They represent a philosophical shift in how trust, privacy, and verification coexist on the internet.
